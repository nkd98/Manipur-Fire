# Manipur-Fire
In the state of Manipur in north-eastern India, violence erupted in the month of May (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Manipur_violence).  Ethnic clashes between the two major communities have resulted in an ongoing crisis in the state. 
I used NASA FIRMS data to visualise Manipur fire incidents during the month of May. It is evident that fire incidents mostly happened during the initial days of May. Most of these fire locations and timing can be mapped to major incidents of violence in the state. This can be used as a complementary tool to identify events in remote areas and verify reported events.
