# Manipur-Fire
I used NASA FIRMS data to visualise Manipur fire incidents during the month of May. This data can be used as an approximation to understand locations of Manipur ethnic violence. 
It is evident that fire incidents mostly happened during the initial days of May. The timing and location of major violent incidents can be mapped to these fire incidents.
